        <h1>Welcome to my blog.</h1>
        <p>
          These are my words, inspired by my passion for sport, music, travel
          and observations on life. I hope to take you on a journey to enjoy
          some of the latest sporting events, focusing particularly on rugby,
          football and cricket; to check out and review some of the latest gigs
          and visit some amazing places.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sport is in my blood, it always has been. The joy of playing, watching
          and writing about sport, started at a very young age and it has never
          left me. The same excitement and passion applies to &apos;live&apos;
          music. Seeing it, hearing it, feeling it and then reviewing it. I
          relish all different kinds of gigs &#8209; from those in iconic
          arenas, festivals to smaller and more intimate venues. Travel is the
          perfect partner to these events, enriching and enhancing the diverse
          cultural world we are living in, visiting new destinations,
          landscapes, cities, hotels and restaurants.
        </p>
        <p>
          Watto&apos;sWords aims to be a little different to most other blogs,
          offering a fresh perspective and covering a wide range of interests
          and subjects. I will seek to share, inform and entertain; to provoke
          debate and stimulate the mind; to applaud but at the same time to
          critically review and above all to write with passion, feeling and
          freedom.
        </p>
        <p>
          This blog also holds special significance for me. Whilst I have been
          writing for many years, this blog in its new form represents something
          new, a fresh start, new energy, new opportunities and a new life. It
          has been some journey.
